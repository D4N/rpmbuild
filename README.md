My RPM specs for software I maintain in Fedora


## About

Repository of RPM packaging assets (SPECS) created for Fedora packages or other purposes.
Most of these packages are either available in Fedora via [Bodhi](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/users/nasirhm) or published as [COPR repositories](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/nasirhm/).
Improvements and changes to the official Fedora package RPM specs in this repository are welcome and encouraged.
